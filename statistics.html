      <h2> Why should we care?</h2>
      <p>Why? This is because as the overpopulation of stray animals may lead to both the environment(wildlife) and us being affected. The overpopulation of strays may increase the spread of disease to wildlife as well as be an invasive species in the ecosystem. Another reason we should care about stray animals is due to the fact that many stray animal that do have diseases have zoonotic diseases, a disease that can spread to humans for example; rabies and the overpopulation of stray animals only amplifies the spread of them.</p>
