      <h2>What we did</h2>
      <p>As a community project, our goal is to “identify and address a need” within the community; reflecting/improving upon that need. Me and my group choose the Animal topic due to the fact that we feel like there is more that can be done for our lovely pet friends. We later came to the conclusion that there are too many stray and lonely animals around the neighborhoods of Charlotte… So here we are!!</p>

      <h3>Planning and investigating</h3>
      <p>Me and my group started researching ways to raise awareness, we noticed there was a pet shelter that would best fit our project. We learned that there were over 70 million stray cats and dogs living in the U.S. with as many as 70,000 born per day. We also found it interesting that most of us encountered a few stray animals around the areas in which we live. </p>
      <p>After researching, we decided to meet up with the animal shelter and each create unique posters around the school.</p>
      <h3> Executing the plan!</h3>
       <ol>
         <li>We visited some animal shelters near us. There was even an event that we got to experience!!! It was called Pet Palooza.</li>
         <li>We made posters every day based on the lovely pets in the animal shelter! Spreading awareness and persuaded people to getting involved. </li>
         <li>We check to see if there are any cats who have been adopted.</li>
         <li>We finalize our presentation!</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
      <p>Finally we were able to finish our goals of spreading awareness on stray animals and we are all happy about it. We were able to get several stray animals adopted, and to do this we made posters, and spread them around our school. The reason we did this was so that people are aware of the problems stray animals pose to us. What we liked about this project was interacting with animals in person. Furthermore something we would like to encourage future viewers about this project is to plan much earlier for upcoming events such as going to places and communicating with others, try not to procrastinate on the work at hand, and to have fun whilst doing this project. By doing this project, many/some people at least were able to learn and protect the lives of domestic pets. In conclusion we were able to improve upon the need to adopt and raise stray animals for a better community. </p>
