     <h2>What are stray animals?</h2>
     <h4>When you hear the word stray, what comes up on your mind?</h4>
     <p>Stray Animals are exactly what they sound like; Animals that are lost, or estray. This usually occurs due to the animal escaping or getting far enough away from the owner that they are lost, or if the owner does no longer want the animal, and instead of correctly putting it up for adoption or bringing it to a Shelter, the owner will just kick the animal out of the home. Although bringing your animal to a shelter is better than leaving it out on the road, there are downsides, like animals being neutered, or possibly abused, if you do not choose the right shelter.</p>

     <p> The direct definition/criteria that decides if an animal is considered stray is if any domestic animal is found  wandering at large or lost, particularly if the owner is unknown. In most cases, this implies domesticated animals rather than pets.</p>
     <p>However, this can vary from animal to animal, and not all animals are in shelters because they are stray. It is just a good few of them happen to fall under this one category.</p>
     <p>Another thing is that shelters/pounds can take the animal from the home if the animal is not cooperative, or if the animal bites one of the members of that residence, the dog can be taken away and possibly put down.</p>
